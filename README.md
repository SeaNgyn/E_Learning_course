# E_Learning_course
This is a project for an online learning website with key features that allow learners to easily make purchases through various payment methods, study, interact, ask questions, and practice courses related to the topics they are interested in. My website is developed using the C# programming language on the ASP.NET Core framework with the ASP.NET Razor Pages model. Data is stored in SQL Server and managed via SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). The teamâ€™s tasks and responsibilities are managed on Jira, the project source code is hosted on GitLab, and data is stored on a third-party service, Microsoft Azure, specifically Azure Blob Storage.
